# 📊 Revenue Analytics Dashboard — Tableau Project

This project presents a comprehensive revenue analysis dashboard built in Tableau, focusing on recurring revenue metrics, trends, and cohort analysis for paid users. The dataset was processed from a CSV file and visualized using Tableau only — without SQL or external tools.

## 🔍 Dashboard Focus (Dashboard 3)
The dashboard consolidates core insights and is structured into three main analytical blocks:

### 1. **Cohort Analysis of Revenue from Users**
- Rows: Month when the user became a paying customer
- Columns: Number of months since first payment
- Values: Total Revenue per cohort per month
- 💡 Gradient fill shows retention and revenue trends

### 2. **Total Revenue & % Change Compared to Previous Month**
- Red bars: Percentage difference from previous month
- Blue line: Absolute Total Revenue
- Highlights monthly growth trends

### 3. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**
- Bar chart of monthly revenue from new users
- Tracks acquisition-driven revenue growth
